# digit-recognizer
An interactive web application that recognizes handwritten digits drawn on a canvas. Built with TensorFlow for digit classification and Flask for backend deployment. The app lets users draw digits (0â€“9), sends the drawing to a trained model, and predicts the digit in real time with a clean UI.
